        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.
        </p>
        <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
          arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
          concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of
          a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
          theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
          claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
          or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
          Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.

          agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
          exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall
